# Singly Linked List - Swift
This is just one way to implement this kind of list.
We are going to implement:

**Node**:
 - With a value and its next Node (if it exists)

**LinkedList**:
-  head: the head of the list
-  tail: the tail of the list
-  isEmpty: retuns if the list is empty or not
-  append(_ value: T): Create a new node and append it at the end of the list
-  removeAll(): Remove all nodes
-  remove(at: Int): Remove a node in a specific index

*This is still in progress and it is used to practice.*
